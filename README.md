## react-codemod [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reactjs/react-codemod.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/reactjs/react-codemod)

This repository contains a collection of codemod scripts for use with
[JSCodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) that help update React
APIs.

### Usage
`npx react-codemod <transform> <path> [...options]`
   * `transform` - name of transform, see available transforms below. 
   * `path` - files or directory to transform
   * use the `--dry` option for a dry-run and use `--print` to print the output for comparison

This will start an interactive wizard, and then run the specified transform. 

### Included Transforms

#### `create-element-to-jsx`

Converts calls to `React.createElement` into JSX elements.

```sh
npx react-codemod create-element-to-jsx <path>
```

#### `error-boundaries`

Renames the experimental `unstable_handleError` lifecycle hook to `componentDidCatch`.

```sh
npx react-codemod error-boundaries <path>
```

#### `findDOMNode`

Updates `this.getDOMNode()` or `this.refs.foo.getDOMNode()` calls inside of
`React.createClass` components to `React.findDOMNode(foo)`. Note that it will
only look at code inside of `React.createClass` calls and only update calls on
the component instance or its refs. You can use this script to update most calls
to `getDOMNode` and then manually go through the remaining calls.

```sh
npx react-codemod findDOMNode <path>
```

#### `manual-bind-to-arrow`

Converts manual function bindings in a class (e.g., `this.f = this.f.bind(this)`) to arrow property initializer functions (e.g., `f = () => {}`).

```sh
npx react-codemod manual-bind-to-arrow <path>
```

#### `pure-component`

Converts ES6 classes that only have a render method, only have safe properties
(statics and props), and do not have refs to Functional Components.

The wizard will ask for 2 options - 

* **Use arrow functions?**: converts to arrow function. Converts to `function` by default.  
* **Destructure props?**: will destructure props in the argument where it is safe to do so.  

```sh
npx react-codemod pure-component <path>
```

#### `pure-render-mixin`

Removes `PureRenderMixin` and inlines `shouldComponentUpdate` so that the ES2015
class transform can pick up the React component and turn it into an ES2015
class. NOTE: This currently only works if you are using the master version
(>0.13.1) of React as it is using `React.addons.shallowCompare`

```sh
npx react-codemod pure-render-mixin <path>
```

 * The wizard will ask to optionally override `mixin-name`, and look for it
   instead of `PureRenderMixin`. Note that it is not possible to use a
   namespaced name for the mixin. `mixins: [React.addons.PureRenderMixin]` will
   not currently work.

#### `React-PropTypes-to-prop-types`

Replaces `React.PropTypes` references with `prop-types` and adds the appropriate `import` or `require` statement. This codemod is intended for React 15.5+.

```sh
npx react-codemod React-PropTypes-to-prop-types <path>
```

  * In addition to running the above codemod you will also need to install the `prop-types` NPM package.

#### `rename-unsafe-lifecycles`

Adds `UNSAFE_` prefix for deprecated lifecycle hooks. (For more information about this codemod, see [React RFC #6](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/6))

```sh
npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles <path>
```

#### `react-to-react-dom`

Updates code for the split of the `react` and `react-dom` packages (e.g.,
`React.render` to `ReactDOM.render`). It looks for `require('react')` and
replaces the appropriate property accesses using `require('react-dom')`. It does
not support ES6 modules or other non-CommonJS systems. We recommend performing
the `findDOMNode` conversion first.

```sh
npx react-codemod react-to-react-dom <path>
```

  * After running the automated codemod, you may want to run a regex-based
    find-and-replace to remove extra whitespace between the added requires, such
    as `codemod.py -m -d src --extensions js '(var
    React\s*=\s*require\(.react.\);)\n\n(\s*var ReactDOM)' '\1\n\2'` using
    https://github.com/facebook/codemod.

#### `React-DOM-to-react-dom-factories`

Converts calls like `React.DOM.div(...)` to `React.createElement('div', ...)`. 

```sh
npx react-codemod React-DOM-to-react-dom-factories <path>
```

Converts 

#### `ReactNative-View-propTypes`

Replaces `View.propTypes` references with `ViewPropTypes` and adds the appropriate `import` or `require` statement. This codemod is intended for ReactNative 44+.

```sh
npx react-codemod ReactNative-View-propTypes <path>
```

#### `sort-comp`

Reorders React component methods to match the [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
[react/sort-comp
rule](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/sort-comp.md). (Defaults to ordering of the [Airbnb style
guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/7684892951ef663e1c4e62ad57d662e9b2748b9e/packages/eslint-config-airbnb/rules/react.js#L122-L134).

```sh
npx react-codemod sort-comp <path>
```

### Explanation of the new ES2015 class transform with property initializers
1. Determine if mixins are convertible. We only transform a `createClass` call to an ES6 class component when:
  - There are no mixins on the class, or
  - `options['pure-component']` is true, the `mixins` property is an array and it _only_ contains pure render mixin (the specific module name can be specified using `options['mixin-module-name']`, which defaults to `react-addons-pure-render-mixin`)
2. Ignore components that:
  - Call deprecated APIs. This is very defensive, if the script finds any identifiers called `isMounted`, `getDOMNode`, `replaceProps`, `replaceState` or `setProps` it will skip the component
  - Explicitly call `this.getInitialState()` and/or `this.getDefaultProps()` since an ES6 class component will no longer have these methods
  - Use `arguments` in methods since arrow functions don't have `arguments`. Also please notice that `arguments` should be [very carefully used](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers#3-managing-arguments) and it's generally better to switch to spread (`...args`) instead
  - Have inconvertible `getInitialState()`. Specifically if you have variable declarations like `var props = ...` and the right hand side is not `this.props` then we can't inline the state initialization in the `constructor` due to variable shadowing issues
  - Have non-primitive right hand side values (like `foo: getStuff()`) in the class spec
3. Transform it to an ES6 class component
  1. Replace `var A = React.createClass(spec)` with `class A extends React.Component {spec}`. If a component uses pure render mixin and passes the mixins test (as described above), it will extend `React.PureComponent` instead
    - Remove the `require`/`import` statement that imports pure render mixin when it's no longer being referenced
  2. Pull out all statics defined on `statics` plus the few special cased statics like `childContextTypes`, `contextTypes`, `displayName`, `getDefaultProps()`, and `propTypes` and transform them to `static` properties (`static propTypes = {...};`)
    - If `getDefaultProps()` is simple (i.e. it only contains a return statement that returns something) it will be converted to a simple assignment (`static defaultProps = ...;`). Otherwise an IIFE (immediately-invoked function expression) will be created (`static defaultProps = function() { ... }();`). Note that this means that the function will be executed only a single time per app-lifetime. In practice this hasn't caused any issues â€” `getDefaultProps` should not contain any side-effects
  3. Transform `getInitialState()`
    - If there's no `getInitialState()` or the `getInitialState()` function is simple (i.e., it only contains a return statement that returns something) then we don't need a constructor; `state` will be lifted to a property initializer (`state = ...;`)
      - However, if the RHS of `return` contains references to `this` other than `this.props` and/or `this.context`, we can't be sure about what you'll need from `this`. We need to ensure that our property initializers' evaluation order is safe, so we defer `state`'s initialization by moving it all the way down until all other property initializers have been initialized
    - If `getInitialState()` is not simple, we create a `constructor` and convert `getInitialState()` to an assignment to `this.state`
      - `constructor` always have `props` as the first parameter
      - We only put `context` as the second parameter when (one of) the following things happen in `getInitialState()`:
        - It accesses `this.context`, or
        - There's a direct method call `this.x()`, or
        - `this` is referenced alone
      - Rewrite accesses to `this.props` to `props` and accesses to `this.context` to `context` since the values will be passed as `constructor` arguments
        - Remove _simple_ variable declarations like `var props = this.props;` and `var context = this.context`
      - Rewrite top-level return statements (`return {...};`) to `this.state = {...}`
        - Add `return;` after the assignment when the return statement is part of a control flow statement (not a direct child of `getInitialState()`'s body) and not in an inner function declaration
  4. Transform all non-lifecycle methods and fields to class property initializers (like `onClick = () => {};`). All your Flow annotations will be preserved
    - It's actually not necessary to transform all methods to arrow functions (i.e., to bind them), but this behavior is the same as `createClass()` and we can make sure that we won't accidentally break stuff
4. Generate Flow annotations from `propTypes` and put it on the class (this only happens when there's `/* @flow */` in your code and `options['flow']` is `true`)
  - Flow actually understands `propTypes` in `createClass` calls but not ES6 class components. Here the transformation logic is identical to [how](https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/src/typing/statement.ml#L3526) Flow treats `propTypes`
  - Notice that Flow treats an optional propType as non-nullable
    - For example, `foo: React.PropTypes.number` is valid when you pass `{}`, `{foo: null}`, or `{foo: undefined}` as props at **runtime**. However, when Flow infers type from a `createClass` call, only `{}` and `{foo: undefined}` are valid; `{foo: null}` is not. Thus the equivalent type annotation in Flow is actually `{foo?: number}`. The question mark on the left hand side indicates `{}` and `{foo: undefined}` are fine, but when `foo` is present it must be a `number`
  - For `propTypes` fields that can't be recognized by Flow, `$FlowFixMe` will be used
5. `React.createClass` is no longer present in React 16. So, if a `createClass` call cannot be converted to a plain class, the script will fallback to using the `create-react-class` package.
  - Replaces `React.createClass` with `ReactCreateClass`.
  - Adds a `require` or `import` statement for `create-react-class`. The import style is inferred from the import style of the `react` import. The default module name can be overridden with the `--create-class-module-name` option.
  - Prunes the `react` import if there are no more references to it.

#### Usage
```bash
npx react-codemod class <path>
```

### jscodeshift options

To pass more options directly to jscodeshift, use `--jscodeshift="..."`. For example:
```sh
npx react-codemod --jscodeshift="--run-in-band --verbose=2"
```

See all available options [here](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift#usage-cli). 

### Recast Options

Options to [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast)'s printer can be provided
through jscodeshift's `printOptions` command line argument

```sh
npx react-codemod <transform> <path> --jscodeshift="--printOptions='{\"quote\":\"double\"}'"
```

#### `explicit-require=false`

If you're not explicitly importing React in your files (eg: if you're loading React with a script tag), you should add `--explicit-require=false`.
